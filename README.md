# Predicting NASA Turbo Engine Remaining Useful Life with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using Machine Learning techniques. The analysis is based on NASA's Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset, implementing various ML algorithms to forecast when an engine might fail.
